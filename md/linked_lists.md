# Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element points to the next, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion.

Linked lists are often compared to [Arrays](arrays.md) for their differences in memory allocation. Once you understand linked lists, you can proceed to learn about [Graphs](graphs.md) to see how nodes connect in non-linear ways.
