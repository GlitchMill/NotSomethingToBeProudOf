# Graphs

Graphs are structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. Each node (or vertex) in a graph may be connected by edges.

Graphs build on both [Arrays](arrays.md) and [Linked Lists](linked_lists.md). If you're new to DSA, consider starting with the [Introduction to DSA](introduction.md).
